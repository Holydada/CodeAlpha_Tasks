                                       How It Works
                                       

Adding Tasks: You can add a new task by typing it in the input field and clicking the "Add" button or by pressing the "Enter" key.

Marking as Complete: Clicking the "âœ”" button will mark a task as completed, which strikes it through and dims the text.

Deleting Tasks: Clicking the "ðŸ—‘" button removes the task from the list entirely.

The tasks are stored in localStorage to ensure they persist across page reloads.
